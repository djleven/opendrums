This uses the Rock Band drum set in Linux. Since it is written in SDL, it should work on any platform that supports SDL and a USB port but I have not tested it yet so it is not guaranteed to work.

Note that this was code was written using the Wii drum kit, it is not guaranteed to work with the XBox or PS3 kits (although someone tried it with XBox and said that it does work).
